# Dargon Camera

This is a FiveM ped-restricted resource that allows players to use a command to view large peds like giants, [dragons](https://popcornrp-store.tebex.io/category/mythical), and other "large" peds from a different angle.

To allow players to use this resource with certain peds, place them in the ped list inside the client.lua. On resource start, any ped in use on that list can use the /dragon camera command to turn off/on the large viewing angle.

Additionally, there are marked areas within the script to edit the camera's sensitivity and distance from the ped. You will need to edit the values based on the ped you're using. By default, these are set for Dragon peds sold by Popcorn RP, which you can find [here](https://popcornrp-store.tebex.io/category/mythical).

Have fun!
