# Dargon Camera

A restricted command for FiveM that allows players to use a command to view large peds from a different angle. 

To allow certain peds to use this resource, place them in the ped list inside of client.lua, and on resource start, any ped in use on that list can use the /dragoncamera command to turn off/on the large viewing angle.

Have fun!
